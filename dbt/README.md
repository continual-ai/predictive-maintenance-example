Here you will find the dbt project used by the Continual team to build out the predictive maintenance use case for our Azure VM example. 

### Using the project

To get started, refer to our guided example on [predictive maintenance](https://docs.continual.ai/predictive-maintenance/) for a more detailed walkthrough. 

To get started with this dbt project, run the following commands (this project utilizes [dbt-utils](https://hub.getdbt.com/dbt-labs/dbt_utils/latest/)):

```sh
dbt deps
dbt run
dbt test
```

If you want to check out the project documentation: 

```sh
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

Once the dbt project has executed, you can create corresponding models and feature sets in Continual by running the following: 

```sh
continual run
```

*Note: Make sure that you have the [Continual CLI](https://docs.continual.ai/installing/) installed and that you have signed in with a selected default project*
